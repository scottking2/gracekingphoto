        It wasn't long ago that I sat in my home watching my two daughters just being. Listening to my then 3 year old playing pretend and giggling. Snuggling my newborn close and taking in every coo and yawn. It was then, when I sat relishing in the beauty of my children and my motherhood, that I felt something. A pull. A calling. A desire to preserve all stages of motherhood as the realization set in that this moment, and all moments, are fleeting.
